# GeoFS-Chat-Fix
Recently the "t" keybind to open the chat dialogue was removed. This script adds it back

# IMPORTANT: 
**This may not work by default on small screens/low resolutions** If this is the case, try zomming out until you see the "TALK" button or a "Send" button. 

Paste directly into console or use tampermonkey. Make sure you are logged into an account and multiplayer and chat is enabled in the settings.

NOTE: this script was made in like 10 minutes, its not tested anywhere. DM me on Discord @zetainbeta_43414 if you encounter any issues!
